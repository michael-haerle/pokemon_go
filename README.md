### Project Outline:
- Create README.md with data dictionary, come up with questions to lead the exploration and the steps to reproduce.
- Acquire data from kaggle and various websites online.
- Clean and prepare data for exploration. Create a function to automate the process, store the function in a prepare.py module, and prepare data in Final Report Notebook by importing and using the funtion.
- Produce at least 4 clean and easy to understand visuals.
- Clearly define hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, and document findings and takeaways.
- Create csv file for other people to use in the future.
- Document conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.


### Project goals: 
- My goal is to perform exploraty analysis on Pokemon Go and the main series Pokemon games.


### Initial questions:
- What pokemon in Pokemon Go has the highest and lowest cp?
- What S tier pokemon in Pokemon Go has the highest and lowest Battle Stat?
- What pokemon in Pokemon Go has the highest and lowest average battle stat between all of their move sets?
- 

### Need to haves (Deliverables):
- A final report notebook
- A function that will take a Pokemon name as an input and output its stats and best moveset.


### Nice to haves (With more time):
 - 


### Steps to Reproduce:

### Stats Test 1: (Ex. Chi Square)


#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is: Blank and Blank are independent
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is: There is a relationship between Blank and Blank

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

#### Results:
- We reject the null hypothesis that Blank and Blank are independent
- There is a relationship between Blank and Blank
- P-Value 
- Chi2 
- Degrees of Freedom
